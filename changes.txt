Here is a summary of the changes made to the codebase to fix the Clerk custom theme issue:

1.  **`app/layout.js`**:
    *   **Change**: Corrected the `baseTheme` property in the `<ClerkProvider>` component.
    *   **Before**: `baseTheme: "shadesOfPurple"`
    *   **After**: `baseTheme: shadesOfPurple`
    *   **Reason**: The `baseTheme` property expects a theme object from `@clerk/themes`, not a string. The `shadesOfPurple` theme was already imported, so I passed the variable directly.

2.  **`app/(auth)/layout.js`**:
    *   **Change**: Modified the `AuthLayout` component to render its `children`.
    *   **Before**: The component was returning `<SignIn />` directly, ignoring the children.
    *   **After**: The component now wraps the `children` in a `div` to center the content.
    *   **Reason**: The previous implementation was preventing the actual sign-in and sign-up pages from being rendered within the layout, which is necessary for the custom theme to be applied.

3.  **`app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.jsx`**:
    *   **Change**: Replaced the placeholder content with the `<SignIn />` component from Clerk.
    *   **Before**: The page was rendering a simple `div` with the text "signin".
    *   **After**: The page now renders the `<SignIn />` component.
    *   **Reason**: This is the correct way to display the Clerk sign-in form on this page.

4.  **`app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.jsx`**:
    *   **Change**: Created this new file and added the `<SignUp />` component from Clerk.
    *   **Reason**: The sign-up page was missing. This file creates the sign-up page and renders the Clerk sign-up form.
